# Hi, I'm Rich ðŸ‘‹
I'm a self-taught developer working in DevOps at The Home Depot. Prior, I held various titles within the field of Information Technology, and wore many hats at many times.

Although Bash scripting was my first true love and what inspired me to learn how to code, I've worked with a handful of other languages in my personal projects and professional career. My big four are JavaScript, Python, Bash, and Powershell.

While I'm a supporter of Right to Repair, data privacy, and open source, here you'll mainly find my tinkerings with things that have interested me.
